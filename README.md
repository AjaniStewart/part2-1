# part2

##What works
The code had the relevant functions, the main function *almost* works.

##What doesn't
The function <code>removeLeadingSpaces()</code> removed *all* spaces instead of the leading ones. The function <code>countChar</code> exclusively counted '{' and  '}'. I also found the main function hard to follow, with the lack of comments and obscure variable names. I rewrote most of the main function, even though I tried to preserve the original style. I also fixed the 2 functions.
